- Hullo, Iâ€™m @Tea-hatho. I'm English.
- I drink tea.
- I know some python and not much else. I have watched the Brackeys C# Tutorial Series, if that counts for anything.
- I do not think any collaborative projects will involve me.
- Pffft. I'm not going to tell you how to contact me! That could result in collaborating which would mean my above statement was incorrect.
